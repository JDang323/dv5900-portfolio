							<h1>Assignment 5</h1>
							<p>
								This assignment is the Tutorial assignment. For this assignment, we have to choose a tool or a topic such as Grafana, Domo, Bokeh, etc
								to create a step-by-step guide that someone could follow and create some data visuals. It has to include example images and visuals along the way to show
								results. In order to do this, we have to learn the basics on how to use which ever topic we choose to do so that we can create an effective
								guide. The objective of this guide is that it should be clear enough that someone else in the course could follow it and produce visualizations.
							</p>
							<p>
								For this assignment, I will be creating a tutorial on the basics of <strong>Power BI.</strong>
							</p>

							<!--Introduction-->
							<h1>Introduction</h1>
							<blockquote>
								Power BI is an interactive data visualization software that was developed by Microsoft with the focus on business intelligence. 
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								Power BI is used for analyzing and visualizing raw data to present information.
								It combines business analytics, and data visualization to help businesses understand their data and make decisions from it. The core part of Power BI
								is the interactive dashboard that can be created from the data. The raw data is uploaded and then analyzed or transformed as needed and loaded. From there,
								the users can create many different kinds of visualizations and dashboards. Power BI has multiple components such as Power BI Desktop, Service and Mobile but we will focus on Desktop.
							</p>
							<p>It is a powerful tool that is very flexible to meet business needs. The interactivity between all of the visuals and data and how the data can be manipulated
								makes Power BI stand out from the other visualization tools. With features such as Power Querying, DAX (Data Analysis Expression), Visuals and Service, Power BI makes
								for an excellent choice to present data in different ways all the way from very simple to complex. 
							</p>

							<p>Follow along with me and I will show you how to create a basic visual in Power BI!</p>

							<!--Getting Started-->
							<h1>Let's Get Started</h1>
							<h2>System requirements</h2>
							<ul class="alt">
								<li>Windows 10, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019, Windows 11</li>
								<li>Microsoft Power BI Desktop requires Internet Explorer 10 or greater.</li>
								<li>Microsoft Power BI Desktop is available for 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) platforms.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>To get started, be sure that your system meets the requirements outlined above. First,
								let's download Power BI. In this tutorial, we will be using Power BI Desktop. 
								Go to <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/">Power BI Desktop Download</a>, and select
								<b>Download Free</b> to download from the Microsoft Store or for other download options, select <b>See download or language options</b> which will give you setup.exe files. 
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								While Power BI is downloading, make sure to create a Microsoft Account. If you already have one, please sign in. This will allow you to publish your report later.
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								Once you finish downloading and going through the install process, you should have Power BI Desktop correctly installed and ready to go! <b>Don't forget to sign in! This will be important later.</b>
							</p>

							<h2>First Time Launch</h2>
							<p>When you first open Power BI Desktop, it displays the Home Page. From here, you can start with a <b>Blank Report</b> or start with a <b>Data Source.</b>
								There will also be a section for <b>Recommendations</b> that you can select. The section under will display all recent <b>Reports that you've been working on.</b>
							</p>
							<span class="image main">
								<img src="images\powerbi_start.png" alt="" />
							</span>
							
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/powerbi_view_icons.png" alt="" /></span>For this example, we will go ahead and select <b>Blank Report.</b> This will take us to a blank report and default report screen of Power BI.
								On the left side, there are icons for Power BI Desktop Views: <b>Report</b>, <b>Data</b>, <b>Model,</b> and <b>DAX Query View.</b> You can change the view
								at any time by clicking on the icons and is indicated by the vertical line to the left of the icon.
							</p>  
							<p>
								The <b>Report</b> view is the default view for Power BI reports. <br><br>For this example, we won't be worrying about <b>Model View</b> or <b>DAX Querying View</b>. You can find
								more detailed information about <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-relationship-view"><b>Model View</b></a> and 
								<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/dax-query-view"><b>DAX Querying View</b></a> on the Learn Microsoft Webpage. <br><br><br><br>
							</p>

							<!--Preparing Data-->
							<h1>Connecting to the Data</h1>
							<p>Now that we have Power BI Desktop installed and we've looked at the <b>Home Page</b> and <b>Blank Report</b> views, we'll go ahead and connect some data!</p>
							<p>To see all the possible types of data sources that we can upload to Power BI Desktop, select <b>Get Data > More...</b> in the <b>Home</b> tab, and in the <b>Get Data</b> window.
							Scroll through the list to explore all possible options!</p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_get_data.png" alt="" />
								<img src="images/powerbi_get_data_window.png" alt="" />
							</div>
							

							<p>For our example, let's use a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mjdskaggle/2024-population-projections-by-country?select=2024Populations.csv"> 2024 Population Projections by Country dataset</a> from Kaggle! 
								Click <a href="2024Populations.csv" download="HERE"> HERE</a> to download the .csv file. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Let's imagine we are a data analyst that is trying to look at world populations. You have a dataset that contains historical data as well as projected
								populations all across the world. You want to use this data to help you and your peers understand what these trends look like. Using the provided .csv file above,
								we can start populating our Power BI report with actual data.
							</p>
							<p>On the Power BI Desktop <b>Home</b> tab, select <b>Get Data</b> > <b>Text/CSV.</b> From there, open the <b>2024Populations.csv</b> file. Allow a moment for the Power BI to upload the file.</p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/power_bi_select_csv.png" alt="" />
							</div>
							<p><br>Another window will appear showing a preview of the data and a title <b>2024Populations.csv</b>. This window is just previewing the data and giving you
								an idea as to what your data will look like in a Power BI table. At the top, you will see dropdown options for <b>File Origin, Delimiter</b>, and <b>Data Type Detection.</b>
								We will leave those as default options and let Power BI auto detect what type of data it will process and the data type that each column has. 
							</p>
							<p>From here, we can either <b>Load</b> the data as is, or <b>Transform Data</b> to make changes in the table before we load it in the report.</p>
							<p>We will go ahead and click <b>Transform Data</b> to look over the data that Power BI has uploaded and confirm that we are happy with the data types and the stucture that our data is in.</p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_load_or_transform_data.png" alt="" />
							</div>
							<p><br>When you select <b>Transform Data</b>, the Power Query Editor Launches, with a view of the table from our CSV file. The <b>Query Settings</b> pane will display on the right
							but you can toggle it by selecting <b>Query Settings</b> on the <b>View</b> tab of the Power Query Editor.</p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_power_query_editor.png" alt="" />
							</div><br>

							<!--Processing Data-->
							<h1>Data Transformation and Processing</h1>
							<p>Now that we have added our data source, we change and shape the data to meet our needs. When you shape data in Power BI, you are providing
								Power Query Editor step-by-step instructions for adjusting the data while loading and presenting it. The original data source remains unaffected while
								this view of the data is affected.
							</p>
							<p>Shaping and querying the data can mean <i>transforming</i> the data, such as renaming columns or tables, removing rows or column, changing data types, or reordering columns.
							Each change that you do is captured sequentially by Power BI under the <b>Applied Steps</b> in the <b>Query Settings</b> pane. Everytime this query connects to this data source, the steps are carried
							in the same order and in the same way, so the data is always in the same shape that you wanted it for. This shaping process occurs when you use the query in Power BI Desktop or when
							someone uses the shared query.</p>

							<!--Querying Steps-->
							<h2>Querying Steps</h2>
							<p>You will notice that the <b>Applied Steps</b> in <b>Query Settings</b> already has some steps. You can click and highlight each step to see its effect in the Power Query Editor on the data.
							The first step was to get the data source, which was uploaded from a CSV file. Once it uploaded the data, it promoted the headers that were in the CSV file to headers in the table itself.
							And lastly, because we allowed the <b>Data Type Detection</b> to be based on the first 200 rows, Power Query Editor looked at the first 200 rows for each column and changed the data type for each column through automatic recognition.
							For example, it turned the "unMember" column into True/False data type and the Populations to <b>Whole Numbers.</b> </p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_applied_steps.png" alt="" />
							</div><br>

							<!--Data Types-->
							<h2>Data Types</h2>
							<p>If we need to change the data type of a column, select the column or column we want to change. You can either right-click a column header, and select <b>Change Type</b> and choose a new data type from the menu,
							or drop down the list next to <b>Data Type</b> in the <b>Transform</b> group in the <b>Home</b> tab, and select a new data type. You can also change the data types by clicking the data type icon next to the Column Headers.</p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_change_data_type_query.png" alt="" />
							</div><br>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_change_data_type_home_row.png" alt="" />
							</div><br>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_change_data_type_icons.png" alt="" />
							</div><br>

							<p>In our example, we'll leave all of the data types alone because the data we provided is fairly clean and consistent that Power BI Desktop was able to automatically detect the intended data types that work well for the data.</p>
							
							<!--Data Transform-->
							<h2>Transforming Data</h2>
							<p>We will go ahead and transform the data. For example, let's go ahead and sort the data by having the <b>pop2030</b> column <b>Sort Descending</b>
							and let's also delete the <b>unMember</b> column too by right-clicking the column header and clicking the appropriate option.</p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_sort_pop2030.png" alt="" />
								<img src="images/powerbi_delete_unMember.png" alt="" />
							</div><br>

							<p>You will see in the <b>Applied Steps</b> in the <b>Query Settings</b> that your last 2 steps have been applied to the query. You sorted a row by sorting the <b>pop2030</b> by descending
							and Removed Columns by deleting <b>unMember</b>. You can click back and forth between each step to see what happened to that data at that step.</p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_applied_steps_new.png" alt="" />
							</div><br>

							<p>Once you finish transforming your data and shaping it into a way that you want, you are ready to start building reports! Let's apply these changes in the <b>Power Query Editor</b> and load them
							into Power Bi Desktop by selecting <b>Close & Apply</b> from the <b>Home</b> tab of the ribbon. If you want to keep the Power Query Editor open, you can just click <b>apply.</b> </p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_query_closeappy.png" alt="" />
							</div>

							<!--Creating Visualizations and Dashboards-->
							<h1>Creating Reports</h1>
							<p>Now that you've finished transforming your data and applying your query, you are ready to build your report and create visuals! This is the <b>Report View</b> and it has the following main parts:</p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_reports_home.png" alt="" />
							</div><br>
							<ol>
								<li>The tool ribbon at the top shows common tasks associated with reports and visualizations.</li>
								<li>The canvas area in the middle which is where all visualizations will be created, edited and arranged.</li>
								<li>The Pages tab at the bottom, which lets us add pages and navigate between them in the report.</li>
								<li>The <b>Filters</b> pane, where the visualizations can get filtered based on the data present.</li>
								<li>The <b>Visualizations</b> pane, where you can add, change, or customize visualizations, and apply drillthroughs.</li>
								<li>The <b>Format</b> pane, where you design the report and visualizations</li>
								<li>The <b>Data</b> pane, which shows the available data in the query from our data. You can drag any data onto the canvas, the <b>Filters</b> pane, or the <b>Visualizations</b> pane to create and modify visualizations.</li>
							</ol>
							<p> You can expand and collapse the <b>Filters</b>, <b>Visualizations</b>, and <b>Data</b> panes by selecting on the double arrows at the top of the panes. This gives you more space to work with.</p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_closing_panes.png" alt="" />
							</div>
							
							<h2>Table View</h2>
							<p><b>Table View</b> in Power BI Desktop gives us an overview of what our data looks like after transforming and shaping it.</p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_tableView.png" alt="" />
							</div><br>


							<h2>Your First Visualiation!</h2>
							<p>Let's create the first our first visualization! Just select any Data in the <b>Data</b> pane, or drag the data from the list onto the canvas. For example,
							drag the <b>country</b> data from <b>2024Populations</b> onto the canvas and see what happens!</p>
							<blockquote>You may run into an error with the map visual. If so, just follow the prompt on the visual.</blockquote>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_map_error_fix.png" alt="" />
							</div><br>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_country_map_small.png" alt="" />
							</div><br>

							<p>You've create your first visual! Power BI Desktop is able to detect what kind of data is in a certain column and give you a map since all of the data in that column were countries!
								Go ahead and enlarge the map for a better view. You will see blue little dots on the coutries in the world. The map is also interactive. You can move it around and zoom in as well!
								Power BI has a strong system that has a lot of details in the maps. You can zoom in all the way down to the street names!
							</p>

							<p>If you hover your mouse over any of the dots, it will give you a tooltip and tell you the name of the country.</p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_hover-Countries.png" alt="" />
							</div><br>

							<!--Customizing your visual-->
							<h2>Customizing your Visual</h2>
							<p>With your new map visualization selected, you'll see in the <b>Visualiations</b> pane different options for editting it. Let's click on the <b>Format Visual</b> icon.</p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_visualization_format.png" alt="" />
							</div><br>
							<p>From here, you have a lot of control for how the visualization works. These <b>Visual</b> options available will be different for different visuals such as bar charts or pie charts. It is specific to the type of data visual.
							However, the <b>General</b> Format options will be the same for every visual. Go ahead and play around with it to see how different options affect the map. Try changing the title of the visual to <b>Country Population 2030 Prediction and change the bubble colors to green!</b></p>
							
							<p>Now your visual should look something like this.</p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_map_nosum.png" alt="" />
							</div><br>

							<p>Let's go ahead and add a little more data to the map. With the map selected, check the box next to <b>pop2030</b>. You will see in the <b>Build Visual</b> section in the <b>Visualization</b> pane that the Bubble Size gets populated with <b>Sum of pop2030</b>
							This occurs because Power BI Automatically detects which it thinks is the best to show that data on the current visual. You can change it by dragging and dropping that box into other areas but let's leave it as it is in the best spot for our visual.</p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_map_bubbleSize.png" alt="" />
							</div><br>

							<h2>Tooltips</h2>
							<p>If you try hovering over the new map with differnt size bubbles, you will see the tooltip has been updated with the data that we just added! Cool right? If we wanted
								to have the tooltip show that data but without the different bubble sizes, we would have to click and drag the <b>Sum of pop2030</b> into the <b>Tooltips</b> section of the <b>Visualizations</b> pane under <b>Build visual.</b>
								For now, let's leave the <b>Sum of pop2030</b> in the <b>Bubble size</b> section. Take a look at how your map visual changed! It should have different bubble sizes, proportionate to the population data we just added.
							</p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_map_bubbleSize_tooltip_swap.png" alt="" />
							</div><br>

							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_map.png" alt="" />
							</div><br>

							<p>Let's try adding more information to the tooltip! With the visualization selected again, click and drag <b>Rank</b>, <b>Density_2024</b>, and <b>2024WorldPercentage</b> into the <b>Tooltips</b> section on the <b>Visualiations</b> pane.</p>
							<p>However, the name of the tooltip data isn't very visually pleasing with "Sum of...". Click on the arrow next to the field and rename it for this visual! Let's change it to <b>Rank</b>, <b>Density</b>, and <b>Percentage of World</b></p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_tooltip_rename.png" alt="" />
							</div><br>
							<p>In that same menu for the World Percentage, navigate to <b>Show Value as</b> and select <b>Percent of grand total</b>. This will represent that data as a percentage, which makes more sense.</p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_tooltip_valueas.png" alt="" />
							</div><br>
							<p>Now the tooltip should look like this, with all new data to give more information on the same visual.</p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_tooltip_new.png" alt="" />
							</div><br>

							<!--Publishing and Sharing-->
							<h1>Saving and Publishing your New Report</h1>

							<!--Savings-->
							<h2>Saving your Report</h2>
							<p>Congratulations! You've made your own Power BI Desktop Visuals. Now, how can you share this with peers or colleagues? It is very simple! Let's give it a go.</p>
