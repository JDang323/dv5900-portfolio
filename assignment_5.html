							<h1>Assignment 5</h1>
							<p>
								This assignment is the Tutorial assignment. For this assignment, we have to choose a tool or a topic such as Grafana, Domo, Bokeh, etc
								create a step-by-step guide that someone could follow and create some data visuals. It has to include example images and visuals along the way to show
								results. In order to do this, we have to learn the basics on how to use which ever topic we choose to do so that we can create an effective
								guide. The objective of this guide is that soemone should be clear enough that someone else in the course could follow it and produce visualizations.
							</p>
							<p>
								For this assignment, I will be creating a tutorial on the basics of <strong>Power BI.</strong>
							</p>

							<!--Introduction-->
							<h1>Introduction</h1>
							<blockquote>
								Power BI is an interactive data visualization software that was developed by Microsoft with the focus on business intellegence. 
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								Power BI is used for analyzing and visualizing raw data to present information.
								It combines business analytics, and data visualization to help businesses understand their data and make decisions from it. The core part of Power BI
								are the interactive dashboard that can be created from the data. The raw data is uploaded and then anaylzed or transformed as needed and loaded. From there,
								the users can create many different kinds of visualizations and dashboards. Power BI has multiple components such as Power BI Desktop, Service and Mobile.
							</p>
							<p>It is a powerful tool that is very flexible to meet business needs. The interactivity between all of the visuals and data and how the data can be manipulated
								makes Power BI stand out from the other visualization tools. With features such as Power Querying, DAX (Data Analysis Expression), Visuals and Service, Power BI, makes
								for an excellent choice to presenting data in different ways all the way from very simple to complex. 
							</p>

							<p>Follow along with me and I will show you how to create a basic visual in Power BI!</p>

							<!--Getting Started-->
							<h1>Let's Get Started</h1>
							<h2>System requirements</h2>
							<ul class="alt">
								<li>Windows 10, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019, Windows 11</li>
								<li>Microsoft Power BI Desktop requires Internet Explorer 10 or greater.</li>
								<li>Microsoft Power BI Desktop is available for 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) platforms.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>To get started, be sure that your system meets the requirements outlined above. First,
								let's download Power BI. In this tutorial, we will be using Power BI Desktop. 
								Go to <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/">Power BI Desktop Download</a>, and select
								<b>Download Free</b> to download from the Microsoft Store or for other download options, select <b>See download or language options</b> which will give you setup.exe files. 
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								While Power BI is downloading, make sure to create a Microsoft Account. If you already have one, please sign in. This will allow you to publish your report later.
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								Once you finish downloading and going through the install process, you should have Power BI correctly installed and ready to go!
							</p>

							<h2>First Time Launch</h2>
							<p>When you first open Power BI Desktop, it displays the Home Page. From here, you can start with a <b>Blank Report</b> or start with a <b>Data Source.</b>
								There will also be a section for <b>Recommendations</b> that you can select. It will display all recent <b>Reports that you've been working on.</b>
							</p>
							<span class="image main">
								<img src="images\powerbi_start.png" alt="" />
							</span>
							
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/powerbi_view_icons.png" alt="" /></span>For this example, we will go ahead and select <b>Blank Report.</b> This will take us to a blank report and default report screen of Power BI.
								On the left side, there are icons for Power BI Desktop Views: <b>Report</b>, <b>Data</b>, <b>Model,</b> and <b>DAX Query View.</b> You can change the view
								at any time by clicking on the icons and is indicated by the vertical line to the left of the icon.
							</p>  
							<p>
								The <b>Report</b> view is the default view for Power BI reports. <br><br>For this example, we won't be worrying about <b>Model View</b> or <b>DAX Querying View</b>. You can find
								more detailed information about <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-relationship-view"><b>Model View</b></a> and 
								<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/dax-query-view"><b>DAX Querying View</b></a> on the Learn Microsoft Webpage. <br><br><br><br>
