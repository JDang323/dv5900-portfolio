							<h1>Assignment 5</h1>
							<p>
								This assignment is the Tutorial assignment. For this assignment, we have to choose a tool or a topic such as Grafana, Domo, Bokeh, etc
								create a step-by-step guide that someone could follow and create some data visuals. It has to include example images and visuals along the way to show
								results. In order to do this, we have to learn the basics on how to use which ever topic we choose to do so that we can create an effective
								guide. The objective of this guide is that soemone should be clear enough that someone else in the course could follow it and produce visualizations.
							</p>
							<p>
								For this assignment, I will be creating a tutorial on the basics of <strong>Power BI.</strong>
							</p>

							<!--Introduction-->
							<h1>Introduction</h1>
							<blockquote>
								Power BI is an interactive data visualization software that was developed by Microsoft with the focus on business intellegence. 
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								Power BI is used for analyzing and visualizing raw data to present information.
								It combines business analytics, and data visualization to help businesses understand their data and make decisions from it. The core part of Power BI
								are the interactive dashboard that can be created from the data. The raw data is uploaded and then anaylzed or transformed as needed and loaded. From there,
								the users can create many different kinds of visualizations and dashboards. Power BI has multiple components such as Power BI Desktop, Service and Mobile.
							</p>
							<p>It is a powerful tool that is very flexible to meet business needs. The interactivity between all of the visuals and data and how the data can be manipulated
								makes Power BI stand out from the other visualization tools. With features such as Power Querying, DAX (Data Analysis Expression), Visuals and Service, Power BI, makes
								for an excellent choice to presenting data in different ways all the way from very simple to complex. 
							</p>

							<p>Follow along with me and I will show you how to create a basic visual in Power BI!</p>

							<!--Getting Started-->
							<h1>Let's Get Started</h1>
							<h2>System requirements</h2>
							<ul class="alt">
								<li>Windows 10, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019, Windows 11</li>
								<li>Microsoft Power BI Desktop requires Internet Explorer 10 or greater.</li>
								<li>Microsoft Power BI Desktop is available for 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) platforms.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>To get started, be sure that your system meets the requirements outlined above. First,
								let's download Power BI. In this tutorial, we will be using Power BI Desktop. 
								Go to <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/">Power BI Desktop Download</a>, and select
								<b>Download Free</b> to download from the Microsoft Store or for other download options, select <b>See download or language options</b> which will give you setup.exe files. 
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								While Power BI is downloading, make sure to create a Microsoft Account. If you already have one, please sign in. This will allow you to publish your report later.
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								Once you finish downloading and going through the install process, you should have Power BI correctly installed and ready to go!
							</p>

							<h2>First Time Launch</h2>
							<p>When you first open Power BI Desktop, it displays the Home Page. From here, you can start with a <b>Blank Report</b> or start with a <b>Data Source.</b>
								There will also be a section for <b>Recommendations</b> that you can select. It will display all recent <b>Reports that you've been working on.</b>
							</p>
							<span class="image main">
								<img src="images\powerbi_start.png" alt="" />
							</span>
							
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/powerbi_view_icons.png" alt="" /></span>For this example, we will go ahead and select <b>Blank Report.</b> This will take us to a blank report and default report screen of Power BI.
								On the left side, there are icons for Power BI Desktop Views: <b>Report</b>, <b>Data</b>, <b>Model,</b> and <b>DAX Query View.</b> You can change the view
								at any time by clicking on the icons and is indicated by the vertical line to the left of the icon.
							</p>  
							<p>
								The <b>Report</b> view is the default view for Power BI reports. <br><br>For this example, we won't be worrying about <b>Model View</b> or <b>DAX Querying View</b>. You can find
								more detailed information about <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-relationship-view"><b>Model View</b></a> and 
								<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/dax-query-view"><b>DAX Querying View</b></a> on the Learn Microsoft Webpage. <br><br><br><br>
							</p>

							<!--Preparing Data-->
							<h1>Connecting to the Data</h1>
							<p>Now that we have Power BI Desktop instaled and we've looked at the <b>Home Page</b> and <b>Blank Report</b> views, we'll go ahead and connect some data!</p>
							<p>To see all the possible types of data sources that we can upload to Power BI Desktop, select <b>Get Data > More...</b> in the <b>Home</b> tab, and in the <b>Get Data</b> window.
							Scroll through the list to explore all possible options!</p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_get_data.png" alt="" />
								<img src="images/powerbi_get_data_window.png" alt="" />
							</div>
							

							<p>For our example, let's use a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mjdskaggle/2024-population-projections-by-country?select=2024Populations.csv"> 2024 Population Projections by Country dataset</a> from Kaggle! 
								Click <a href="2024Populations.csv" download="HERE"> HERE</a> to download the .csv file. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Let's imagine we are a data analyst that is trying to look at world populations. You have a dataset that contains historical data as well as projected
								populations all across the world. You want to use this data to help you and your peers understand what these trends look like. Using the provided .csv file above,
								we can start populating our Power BI report with actual data.
							</p>
							<p>On the Power BI Desktop <b>Home</b> tab, select <b>Get Data</b> > <b>Text/CSV.</b> From there, open the <b>2024Populations.csv</b> file. Allow a moment for the Power BI to uplaod the file.</p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/power_bi_select_csv.png" alt="" />
							</div>
							<p><br>Another window will appear showing a preview of the data and a title <b>2024Populations.csv</b>. This window is just previewing the data and giving you
								an idea as to what your data will look like in a Power BI table. At the top, you will see dropdown options for <b>File Origin, Delimiter</b>, and <b>Data Type Detection.</b>
								We will leave those as default options and let Power BI auto detect what type of data it will process and the data type that each column has. 
							</p>
							<p>From here, we can either <b>Load</b> the data as is, or <b>Transform Data</b> to make changes in the table before we load it in the report.</p>
							<p>We will go ahead and click <b>Transform Data</b> to look over the data that Power BI has uploaded and confirm that we are happy with the data types and the stucture that our data is in.</p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_load_or_transform_data.png" alt="" />
							</div>
							<p><br>When you select <b>Transform Data</b>, the Power Query Editor Launches, with a view of the table from our CSV file. The <b>Query Settings</b> pane will display on the right
							but you can toggle it by selecting <b>Query Settings</b> on the <b>View</b> tab of the Power Query Editor.</p>
							<div class="image-container">
								<img src="images/powerbi_power_query_editor.png" alt="" />
							</div><br>

							<!--Processing Data-->
							<h1>Data Transformation and Processing</h1>
							<p>Now that we have added our data source, we change and shape the data to meet our needs. When you shape data in Power BI, you are providing
								Power Query Editor step-by-step isntructions for adjusting the data while loading and presenting it. The original data source remains unaffected while
								this view of the data is affected.
							</p>
							<p>Shaping and querying the data can mean <i>transforming</i> the data, such as renaming columns or tables, removing rows or column, changing data types, or reodering columns.
							Each change that you do is captured sequentially by Power BI under the <b>Applied Steps</b> in the <b>Query Settings</b> pane. Everytime this query connects to this data source, the steps are carried
							in the same order and in the same way, so the data is always in the same shape that you wanted it for. This shaping process occurs when you use the query in Power BI Desktop or when
							someone uses the shared query.</p>
							<p>You will notice that the <b>Applied Steps</b> in <b>Query Settings</b> already has some steps. You can click and highlight each step to see its effect in the Power Query Editor on the data.
							The first step was to get the data source, which was uploaded from a CSV file. Once it uploaded the data, it promoted the headers that were in the CSV file to headers in the table itself.
							And lastly, because we allowed the <b>Data Type Detection</b> to be based on the first 200 rows, Power Query Editor looked at the first 200 rows for each column and changed the data type for each column through automatic recognition.
							For example, it turned the "unMember" column into True/False data type and the Populations to <b>Whole Numbers.</b> </p>
