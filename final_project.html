									<h2>Introduction</h2>
								</header>
							</section>
							<p>
								Welcome to "Not Just A Cartoon: Anime Trends", an interactive data Visualization project that dives into the beautiful world of anime.
								Anime has been a growing industry with a wide variety of shows, genres, studios, stories, characters and much more. 
								Through a series of insightful, engaging, and clear data visualizations, this project explores various aspects of the anime industry,
								including genre popularity and trends over time, release patterns, audience ratings and the intricate web of anime productions.
								This project aims at both ends of the spectrum when it comes to its target audience. Whether you're a devoted anime fan or a newcomer, I aim 
								to provide a deeper understanding of how anime has evolved and what factors contribute to the growing appeal. Join me on this data-driven journey
								to uncover the trends and stories behind your favorite anime series.
							</p>
							<p>
								Today, we'll walk through different interactive visuals and dashboards that will help you understand the realm and trends of the anime world. First, I will introduce an anime dashboard as the face of the project that
								gives the user a basic dashboard that will help give stats on specific animes. Afterwards, we will dive into looking at genre trends and how they've grown over the years. Next, we'll look at seasonal releases of anime
								in hopes that it will help us understand why anime are released at certain times of the year. An important aspect when trying to understand the anime industry is to see what the audience and fans like. We'll look at some visuals
								to identify trends. Along with this, we can look at how well an anime scores (how it is rated) vs. how many people set it as their favorite. Closing out the analysis would be looking at the Production Analysis of anime. This
								involves looking at what Studio, Licensor, and Producer create the best anime and what the fans really love. With the help of data visualization, we can try take a step into the anime realm. All of the visualizations are interactive in some way.
								Power BI allows for the creation of very dynamic and interactive Dashboards and visualizations.
							</p>

							<blockquote>Note that the data is not up to date. It was last updated 7/31/2023. The dataset used for all the visuals is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dbdmobile/myanimelist-dataset?select=anime-dataset-2023.csv">Anime Dataset 2023.</a></blockquote>

							<blockquote>The core behiond this anime analysis is that the user can manipulate and adjust the visuals in multiple different ways in order to highlight different areas of interest.</blockquote>

							
							<!--Dashbaord-->
							<h2>Anime Dashboard</h2>
							<p>Below is a Power BI Dashboard that can help you search and view some basic statistics about an anime. The filters for <b>Type, Genres, and Studios</b> on the left side can be used to narrow down the choices of anime available based on your
								preference or curiocity. The two search boxes for <b>English Name</b> and <b>Name</b> are for the English translation and the Japanese translation of the anime. Both have been provided because they are used interchangably in the field.
								As your filter changes, the list at the bottom will update and provide you with a list of anime that fit under those categories. Common statistics are displayed on the right side of the screen for more information. The <b>Reset</b> button is used
								to clear all search and filters.
							</p>

							<!--Anime Genres-->
							<br><br><br>
							<h2>Anime Genres Trends</h2>
							<p>The visual below is a dashboard with 2 different pages. The first page is the <b>Genre Breakdown All of Time</b>. This page focuses on showing the makeup of anime over the years. 
								The graph on the left shows how many new anime were released each year by <b>Genre</b>. The <b>Donut Chart</b> on the right shows the anime genre composition. The two graphs are synced so if you click on any of genres in the legend or filter, the graphs
								will automatically update and show you an updated view for the genre. Clicking on the legend will highlight that genre while clicking on a genre in the Filter will show which ever genres that you clicked. The <b>Year</b> filter can also be used to
								see the data within a give year period.
								 </p>
							<p>The second page, <b>Anime Yearly Favorited by Fans</b>, shows how many times a certain genre was favorited in that given year. The <b>Genre</b> filter and the <b>Year</b> filter will do the same as the first page.</p>
							<p>From looking at the number of anime releases and the number of fan favorites per genre, we can see that over the course of over 100 years, the genres that occupy the most space in the anime realm are <b>Comedy, Fantasy, Action, Adventure, and Sci-Fi.</b></p>
							<!--Power BI Animes Genres-->

							<!--Bubble Chart Anime Genre Makeup Tableau-->
							<br><br><p>Looking at the Tableau Bubble Chart, it also tells us the same story, in which genres are more dominant by the size of the bubbles.</p>
							<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1718336424310' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Dashboard 1 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;An&#47;AnimeDashboard_17183311218600&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='AnimeDashboard_17183311218600&#47;Dashboard1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;An&#47;AnimeDashboard_17183311218600&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1718336424310');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='727px';}                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>
							

							<!--Seasonal Releases-->
							<br><br><br><h2>Seasonal Release Analysis</h2>
							<p>Often times, much like any other movie, animes will have a seasonal release date such as "Fall 2020" or "Summer 2021". It can get one person thinking - When do most animes get released? This interactive Power BI graph will be able to tell us.
								When you change the range of the years or even choose a single year, you will find that Winter dominates the release seasons and months! There are a few likely reasons for this:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li><b>Holiday Season:</b> Winter involves a lot holidays and breaks. This free time allows the audience to watch more shows, which is what studios look out for and release more anime around this time.</li>
								<li><b>Audience Preferences:</b> People typically want to stay indoors during the colder months. Being indoors gives more opportunity to watch shows. </li>
								<li><b>Production Timelines:</b> Anime can take a while to plan and make. These plans are usually made earlier in the years, which naturally causese them to line up with a Winter Release.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>The two pages show the number of anime released by season and by month for the filtered time period. You can adjust the filters to see
								different year periods or a specific year which can help us understand when animes are generally released. We can see the trend that the <b>colder months</b> usually get more anime releases.</p>
							<iframe title="Anime Release Patterns" width="1400" height="800" src="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiM2VkNWViZDItYmMwMy00NGE3LWEyN2YtNjI3MWMxNGY5NjY3IiwidCI6Ijk2NWRlODFjLWZjOTgtNGM1My05OTAxLTQxYmQ5M2UyNmUwNiIsImMiOjN9" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe>
							
							<!--Audience Favorites-->
							<br><br><br>
							<h2>Audience Ratings and Favorites</h2>
							<p>When we look for anime to watch, we generally want to look for shows that have a genre we're interested or produced by a Studio's art style we like. Another large factor is the popularity of the anime. We want to see which anime is
								popular, liked and loved by a lot of people. Because it has to be popular for a reason, right? There's gotta be a reason why the anime is talked about a lot. When we take a look at audience and fan trends and see what the majority of people like,
								it can give us a good idea as to what anime or genre may be good!
							</p>
							<p>The visual below presents <b>Fan Favorites by Genre and the Average MyAnimeList Score by genre</b>. It is accompanied by filters that can help you sort out what anime may be best for you in the given list.</p>
							<p>From the graph of fan favorites, we can see that <b>Action, Drama, Fantasy, Adventure, and Comedy</b> are the top 5 most favorited animes by MyAnimeList Users. Clicking on any piece of the bar graph will filter the table to show you what animes are in 
								that genre. The table can be further filtered when we use the <b>Ranking, Year or Genre</b> filters. For example, we can filter for the top 5 genres mentioned before, and set the Ranking filter to be 7+ which will show all the animes with that genre and have a relatively higher score.
							</p>
							<p>When looking at the <b>Average Score by Genre</b>, we can see that <b>Award Winning</b> genre has the highest relative average score, which makes sense! They're Award Winning for a reason, right?! This graph may be a little different from the fan favorites because there are a lot
								more or less animes in different genres that can skew the visual. But overall, this can be used to get a good idea of how well animes in that genre do, based on community feedback.
							</p>
							<iframe title="Anime Fan Favorites" width="1400" height="804" src="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYjUwOWZlMGQtN2ExNS00YTMzLTg4NjgtM2JkZGJiNzlhMTNmIiwidCI6Ijk2NWRlODFjLWZjOTgtNGM1My05OTAxLTQxYmQ5M2UyNmUwNiIsImMiOjN9" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe>
							<!--Score vs. Favorite-->
							<br><br><br><h2>Score vs. Favorites</h2>
							<p>Higher scoring anime must mean that it is more popular right? Based on the graph below, that may not be the case. Most would assume that if the anime scored higher, then it must have more favorites. Looking at the graph, we can see that, yes, an increase in score correlates with
								a higher number of favorites by the community. However, that is only true for anime with ranks ~6 and higher. Once the score is past 6, we can see a more dramatic increase in the number of favorites. This could lead us to the conclusion that, unless an anime is "really good",
								then it probably won't be liked, viewed or favorited by many of those in the community. This emphasizes the point from the previous graph about audience favorites because people will generally watch anime that other people are watching. 
							</p>
							<iframe title="Anime Score vs. Favorites" width="1400" height="800" src="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNDAxMzJhOTUtNmI2MS00YjEwLTk4OTctNTQ4MjIxNmM4ZjI0IiwidCI6Ijk2NWRlODFjLWZjOTgtNGM1My05OTAxLTQxYmQ5M2UyNmUwNiIsImMiOjN9" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe>

							<!--Production Analysis-->
							<br><br><br><h2>Production Analysis</h2>
							<p>Lastly, let's take a look at anime production, specifically, the <b>Studios, Licensors, and Producers</b>. Having these graphs is important because it can help us understand which Studios, Licensors, or Producers are key industry players and who collaborates with who the most
								in order to provide the best anime possible. The first page shows how many animes that each of the 3 are associated with, the second page shows the average anime scores for each and then the last page as the number of animes associated but it has a score filter
								to help	us see which partnership produces the best quality anime all round. </p>
							<p>
								Just like the other data visuals, we can click and interact with the graphs and filters which will update the table below to show you what anime falls under those slicers and filters.
								From looking at the last page, we can see that the top Studios are <b>Production I.G, Madhouse and J.C Staff</b>, the top Licensors are <b>Funimation, Sentai Filmworks, and Aniplex of America</b>, and the top Producers are <b>Aniplex, TV Tokyo, and Dentsu</b>. These have the most anime
								that have an average score of 7.11 and higher! This shows us who the key players are and gives an idea as to what to expect when they produce anime.

									<h2>Anime Library</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Below is a basic anime search library that utilizes the <b>Jikan API</b>, which is an unofficial MyAnimeList API.
									You can search for any anime that is on the MyAnimeList database. Each anime will be presented with its <b>full name, image, 
									genre, and synopsis.</b> Although the dataset used for the above visuals is out of date compared to this search library, it can still be used for most anime that you may find interesting.
									You can search the anime you find interesting here after looking through and analyzing which anime you think you may like! Happy Watching!

							<!--Conclusion-->
							<br><br><h2>Conclusion</h2>
							<p>This project dives into the dynamic world of anime through multiple Power BI interactive Dashboard Visualizations. By analyzing different aspects such as genre popularity, release patterns, audience ratings, and production
								insights, we can reveal significant trends and provide a richer understanding of the anime industry.
							</p>
							<h3>Key findings from the project:</h3>
									<ol>
										<li><b>Genre Popularity Over Time:</b> Action, Drama, Fantasy, Adventure and Comedy are consistently popular genres since 1917, which reflects the audience preference and trends.</li>
										<li><b>Seasonal Releases:</b> Winter dominates the seasonal releases, which is likely due to holiday viewing times and production timelines from Studios.</li>
										<li><b>Audience Ratings:</b> Anime that score higher, generally are more favorited by the community, with dramatic increases in favorites with scores above 6.</li>
										<li><b>Production Analysis:</b> Key industry players like Production I.G, Madhouse, J.C Staff, Funimation, and Aniplex cosnsistnyl produce high-quality anime, which is noted by their influence in our analysis.</li>
									</ol>
							<p>This project successfully points out the intricate and evolving trends of the anime industry. Through the use of interaction data visualizations, we can provide meaningful insight for both dedicated anime fans and new viewers.
								The analysis demonstrated how genre preferences, release patterns, audience engagement, and production partnerships shape and carve the anime landscape and framework. By understanding these trends and visuals, viewers can make informed choices
								about their anime preferences and gain a better understanding and appreciation for the industry's complexities and intricacies.
