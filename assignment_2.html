							<h1>Assignment 2</h1>
							<p>This assignment is the Visualization Makeover. We were tasked to find a real life problematic visualization and create a 
								new version that addresses the issues in the original. Vega-Lite is used for this assignment. The dataset
								used is from the <a href = "https://sabr.org/bioproj/topic/baseball-demographics-1947-2016/" > Society For American Baseball Research. </a>
								The specific dataset we are going to be looking at is <a href = "https://sabr.org/bioproj/topic/baseball-demographics-1947-2016/"> Baseball Demographics, 1974-2016.</a>
							</p>

							<h2>Original Plot</h2>
							<span class="image">
								<img src="images\MLB-Demographics-Armour-Levitt-Figure1.png" alt="" />
							</span>
							<p>
								I chose this graph as a representation of what a problematic visualization looks like. The original data above is a 
								stacked bar chart showing the percentage of baseball players by ethnicity from 1947 to 2016, with the ethnicities 
								being White, African American, Latino and Asian.

								The first problem with the visualization is its clarity. The stacked bar chart makes it challenging to distinguish between
								the different ethnic groups, especially when graphed yearly between 1947 and 2016. It is also difficult to see smaller
								segments of ethniciites such as Asian. The color scheme used also makes it difficult to see the different segments.

								The next problem is the density of the data. It is packed with a lot of data yearly for over 60 years, which can be 
								overwhelming. The gridlines in the origianl visual is hard to see as well which can make analyzing the data difficult.

								The last problem is the legend placement. The legend is placed over the data, which can obscure any important information.
								It is usually best practice to keep the legend from interferring with the data itself.
							</p>
							<h3>New Plot</h3>
							<div id="new_plot"></div>
							<p>
								In the updating of the original visualization, the goal was to improve the clarity and accessibility. 
								I chose to use an area chart format because it is able to better display the trends over time when comparing
								the different ethnic groups. It is a lot easier to distinguish between the ethnic groups now since they are in the
								area chart format. I also changed the collor palette to ensure that the colors are more easily distinguished and that they are 
								color-blind friendly. Even as a non-color blind person, the original graph was hard to distinguish the colors. Adding gridlines
								to the new graph also enhances the readability and allows the viewers to follow the changes and understand the data at 
								specific points on the visualization. The legend was also moved to be next to the graph instead of on top of it so that it does not
								block any data.
